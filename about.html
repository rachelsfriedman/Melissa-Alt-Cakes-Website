            <h3>The Artist</h3>
          
            <p>Melissa's passion for creating cakes began early on when she was just a teen. She would watch cake shows on TV and thought, "I want to try that!". Instantly she spent all of her free time learning anything she could about cake decorating. She was always an artist, working with paint, clay and fashion design, but when she discovered the art of cake, it became her all time favorite medium to work with.</p>  
            <p>Following high school, Melissa was blessed to land an internship with the Cake Boss, where she learnt the fundamentals of cake decoration. She attended college at Pratt Institute, studying painting and sculpture; incorporating edible materials into any project she could. For her final thesis she created a full size woman out of chocolate! After college Melissa turned her passion for cakes into a career, launching Melissa Alt Cakes in 2015. </p>
            <p>Since the start of her business Melissa's cakes have been featured in numerous magazines and reached international recognition. She has created cakes for large scale events and celebrations including clients at Google, Time Out New York and President Donald Trump. Melissa is also the exclusive cake decorator for Dylan's Candy Bar in NYC.</p>
            <p>Melissa's cakes are her art. She strives to create one of a kind artistic creations that form an experience of joy and beauty. Extreme passion, dedication and numerous hours are put into every piece of work Melissa creates. She loves the disbelief of her art actually being food. Her favorite moment is when the creation is cut and her art becomes delicious cake! </p>
            <p>To Melissa there is nothing she loves more than the art of cake and being able to share it with the world:)</p>
